Simple shell that handles input/output redirection, wildcard expansion, pipes, as well as handles built in commands like "cd" and "pwd".
The shell has two modes, interactive mode and batch mode. Interactive mode lets users input commands directly. Batch mode executes commands from a file.
If the program is run without any arguments "./mysh" then it will be in interative mode. If it is run with a batch file, "./mysh batch.txt" then it will be in batch mode.
The conditional aspect of the program only takes one conditional inside of [] brackets.

Our test plan was as follows:
    cd/pwd test
        (inside interactive mode)
        mysh> pwd
        mysh> cd ..
        mysh> pwd
        mysh> which echo

    input / output detection with inputTest.c
        (inside interactive mode)
        mysh> ./inputTest < input3.txt > output13.txt
    
    wildcard detection with printFiles.c
        (inside interactive mode)
        mysh> ./printFiles input*.txt>output1.txt

    pipe testing
        (inside interactive mode)
        mysh> ls -l | grep .txt

    batch mode testing with test_script.sh
        ./mysh test_script.sh
